# dwb-aws-nb-typings
My re-typings of what's done in the AWS MLS Certification course at Udemy from Chandra Lingam. He's an awesome teacher. I don't own anything. Oh, and now, since I can't get the Jupyter Notebooks on AWS working, I'm just bring the notebooks here, and I'll do the re-typing here, too.
